Project Title: WhatsApp Chat Analyzer Using Python & Machine Learning

Description:
This project is a powerful tool for analyzing WhatsApp chat data using Python and machine learning techniques. It allows users to upload exported .txt chat files and gain valuable insights through various analytical features and visualizations. Key functionalities include:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and structuring raw chat data, handling timestamps, user messages, media files, and system notifications.

User Activity Analysis: Identifies the most active users, message frequency by date and time, and peak activity periods.

Text Analysis: Extracts commonly used words, generates word clouds, and tracks message trends over time.

Sentiment Analysis (ML-based): Uses NLP models to detect the emotional tone of messages (positive, negative, or neutral).

Visualization: Interactive charts and graphs for understanding user behavior and chat patterns.

Technology Stack: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, WordCloud, Scikit-learn, NLTK/Spacy, and Streamlit for web deployment.

This project showcases practical applications of machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) in real-world data analysis, offering both technical depth and user-friendly interaction.
